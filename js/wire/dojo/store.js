	/*
		Function: resource
		Resolves a dojo.store.JsonRest for the REST resource at the url
		specified in the reference, e.g. resource!url/to/resource
		
		Reference format:
		resource!resource_url
		
		Reference params:
			get - specifies a particular id to fetch.  If supplied, the item will
				be fetched, and the resolved reference will be a *promise* for the data itself,
				rather than the data store.
			query - specifies a query to issue.  If supplied, the query will be
				executed, and the resolved reference will be a *promise* for the query results,
				rather than the data store.
			wait - If specified and the value is strictly true, instead of resolving to
				*promises*, get and query references (see above) will be resolved to their
				actual data by waiting for the get and query operations (which may be
				asynchronous), to complete.  Note that *this will block wiring* (and thus
				the contextReady event) until the actual data has been fetched, or an
				error or timeout occurs.
		
		Parameters:
			name - url
			refObj - complete JSON ref object in the form { $ref: name }
			wire - wiring factory
			promise - <Promise>, provided by wiring factory, that will be resolved
				with the dojo.store.JsonRest that points to the REST
				resource at the referenced url.
